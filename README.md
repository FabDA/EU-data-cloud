# LATC EU Data Cloud

In the [LATC](http://latc-project.eu/) project we publish open data from existing [EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) data sources as [Linked Data](http://linkeddatabook.com/). We are working on the following datasets:

* Eurostat
* EU Who is Who
* EU Election Results
* EU Press Directory
* EU Central Bank Statistics
* EU Barometer

The following figure gives you an idea of the development and projection of EU-level datasets:
