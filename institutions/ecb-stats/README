Title: ECB Stats
Authors: Keith Alexander, Knud MÃ¶ller

This software project converts SDMX-XML files from the European Central Bank Statistics Warehouse [http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/] into Linked Data.

xml-schema/download-schema.sh downloads XML metadata files from ECB
key_families_to_json.php generates the json representation of the keyfamily metadata, from XML, used by the conversion
key_families_to_rdf.php generates triples from keyfamily.xml
this consists of:
  * dimensions represented as qb:DimensionProperty
  * codes and codelists represented as skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme
  * KeyFamily groups represented as qb:DataStructureDefinition

/crawler (written in ruby) crawls the ECB statistics warehouse collecting "series keys" (ids of statistics series) and some additional metadata, creating
a large CSV file. 

crawler_csv_to_rdf.php converts this to ntriples, describing the series as qb:Slice - mainly by parsing the series key into components and understanding them with reference to the keyfamily.json file.

This metadata will be stored in a triples store and access will be provided through a sparql endpoint and Linked Data API, which will make the URIs dereferencable and allow users to find qb:Slices (but not an observation-level data) by their metadata.

These qb:Slice URIs can then dereference to code in

/sdmx2rdfa/ 

which will fetch the series data for that series key from the ECB site as XML, and publish the observations as RDFa.
